Ball-by-Ball Tracking: Record runs, wickets, and extras (wides/no-balls) instantly.

Database Management: Powered by SQLite, it stores match data, team rosters, and historical stats.

Automated Statistics: Calculates individual batting scores (runs, balls faced) and bowling figures (overs, wickets) on the fly.

Match Summaries: Provides a clear result breakdown (won by runs/wickets) at the conclusion of each game.
